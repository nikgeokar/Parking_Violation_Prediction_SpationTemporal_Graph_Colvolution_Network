# Parking Violation Prediction using Graph Colvolution Networks

Welcome to the git repo for our project on predicting parking violations in Thessaloniki's parking system using Spatio Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN).

Please note that, due to GDPR regulations, the dataset containing historical checks of the municipal police is not publicly available. Therefore, we have included a demo file named "Scan_Data_Reg_2.3.csv" that contains 100 randomly generated records.

To give you a better understanding of our project, the pipeline of our model is illustrated in the figure below.
